# Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator

## Project Overview

This project is based on this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type).

In this dataset tweets from various accounts on Twitter were gather, to each account a Myers-Briggs Personality Type was assigned (column “type”), and the last 50 tweets from each account were collected (column “posts”).

### Myers-Briggs Personality Type

“The purpose of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®) personality inventory is to make the theory of psychological types described by C. G. Jung understandable and useful in people's lives. The essence of the theory is that much seemingly random variation in the behavior is actually quite orderly and consistent, being due to basic differences in the ways individuals prefer to use their perception and judgment.” -[Source](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/)

The MBTI divides people’s personalities into 16 personality types, across 4 axes:

### •	Extroverted/Introverted (E/I):
This axis differentiates were a person gets their energy from:
-	Extroverts gain energy from being around other people: talking, conversing, being noticed, etc. They can be alone but will get tired without contact.
-	Introverts gain energy from being alone and clearing their thoughts. Opposite to extroverts, introverts have the capability to socialize quite effectively; but their alone time is a must.

### •	Intuitive/Sensory (N/S):
Here, the differences lie in how the individual perceives their world. 
-	Intuitives (N) prefer speculation and depth of insight, they are better at perceiving the world through their mind and imagining abstract possibilities in the world.
-	Sensors (S) prefer tangible information, they are better at perceiving the world through the five senses.

### •	Thinking/Feeling (T/F):
This domain deals with how the individual judges the information they have perceived.
-	Thinkers (T) apply logical reasoning, make decisions using impersonal criteria, and focus on tasks.
-	Feelers (F) apply individual values, make decisions by personal circumstances, and focus on relationship.

### •	Judgmental/Perceiving (J/P):
This domain basically states whether the perceiving trait or the judging trait is the dominant trait of the individual.
-	Judgers (J) tend to like a planned and organized approach to life, prefer to have tings settled, and love structure.
-	Perceivers (P) tend lo like a flexible and spontaneous approach to life, prefer to keep their options open, and love freedom.

The 16 personality types are:

## Hypothesis:

•	Ho = Someone’s personality can be determined by their tweets.

•	Ha = Someone’s personality cannot be determined by their tweets.

The goal is to build a machine learning algorithm that attempts to determine someone’s personality based on their tweets.

## Communication Protocol and GitHub

The team will meet weekly (Tuesdays and Thursdays) via Zoom, and on the weekends if needed. There is also, an open communication via Slack.

The roles for each team member are:


•	Square Role (GitHub): Katiusca Quijada.

•	Triangle Role (Machine Learning): Jose Monagas.

•	Circle Role (Database): Eric Wyluda.

•	X Role (Technology): Christopher Guilcapi.


GitHub is the chosen platform to collaborate as a team with this project. All final code will be pushed to the `main` branch, but each collaborator has its own branch:


•	`Kati_branch`

•	`Jose_branch`

•	`Eric_branch`

•	`Chris_branch`

All team members will notifie the Square to create a pull request when their portion of their assignment has been pushed to the repo, and the Square will resolve the issues after each pull request and merge it to the main branch. The Square to notified via Slack each member of the team when the `main` branch is updated and ready for a “git pull.”
